title: Brew install
summary: Install or upgrade dependencies with Homebrew.
description: |-

  Install or upgrade dependencies using Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  Homebrew defines the available packages as formulae. Our Step needs the name of the Homebrew formulae you want to use. 
  
  1. In the **Formula name** input, put the name of the formula you want to download. 
  1. In the **Upgrade formula?** input, set the default behavior for previously installed packages. If the input is set to `yes`, the Step will call `brew reinstall` to upgrade them to the latest version.
  1. In the **Brew install/reinstall options** input, you can set additional flags for the `brew install` or `brew reinstall` commands. 
     For the possible options, see [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask).
